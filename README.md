# Additional Info
## ✅ Code Sample

Upon a recent client request to create a Drupal based currency converter application, i had written a demo code to demonstrate the application through simple steps. The Repo includes the entire application. However, the custom module can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/demodrupaldev/drupal-currency-converter/-/tree/main/web/modules/custom/currency_converter). The module already includes a **README** for better understanding of the functionality.

## ✅ Documentation

I have had the opportunity to write documentation for the purpose of **code navigation** or **functional walkthrough**. This documentations have been done through short video, README file or workshops. Sample documentations can be found here:

## ✅ Challenges
It goes without saying that in day-to-day development, we come across many challenges. However, there are two problems that have been the highlight for me in the past year that happened in the ohchr project mentioned earlier. 

1. Too many blocks

Post migration work, there was a technical fault that was identified. For the purpose of reusability, many of the "reusable" contents were done through blocks and once the migration was done, it was identified that there were 25000+ block within the system which caused the page to stop loading.

Cause: As blocks are plugins in drupal, all plugins are loaded without any pre-condition when a Drupal page first loads which results in timeout.

Solution: A custom block deriver which identifies and loads only "referenced blocks" through for each page. This saved a lot of BE effort and re-work which was a great achievement.

2. Too many views

The entire problem statement, assessment and solution for this point has already been covered in a Drupal session i submitted a couple months back. I've cloned the document and made it available through [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15lk9rD5gdTn-zhJ52LkbDHNWEvCod_ESWvC93IOBGhg/edit?usp=sharing).


## ✅ Conflict Management
In any organization with large teams, there is surely going to be some misunderstandings and conflicts at times. I have been faced with a lot of challenges when working with different teams but I've always used one solution which has worked for me throughout - Discussion. Whenever I'm faced with a colleague whose ideas/methodogies doesn't go well with the team/client, I hold a 1-on-1 and discuss the issue. 

For example, I had an issue with a colleague regarding client requests on a project where the colleague was very defensive in addressing the client's request and answering NO all the time. In order to sort the issue, I set up a call with him trying to understand his point of view which i actually found reasonable but disagreed with his approach. I also understood that i was being too open to the requests as the project was already underway and taking up some breaking changes might have too many consequences. So the solution we came up with was to be "Open to requests" but at the same time "never say Yes/No on the spot". That solution served as well throughout the rest of the project 🏆🏆🏆.
